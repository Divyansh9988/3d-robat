    <h1><U>Human Nature & human parts</U>:-</h1>
<p><h4>We are humans who were created by God . It has been several decades since we were born on Earth. Earlier we did not know anything, neither how to light a fire nor how to take a bath, whatever we got we used to eat it raw. Slowly we kept moving towards development and today we have developed so much that today we can make whatever we like sitting at home Whatever thing we want we can order. But while progressing so much we have forgotten that we are not as God has made us. God made us to help each other and to live together but we have become one They fight with each other and try to humiliate each other, kill living beings and have a feeling of inferiority towards each other. We run after money our whole life thinking that if we earn today we will sit and eat tomorrow but who knows about tomorrow, we know that we cannot take money with us after death, still we run after money our whole life thinking that if we earn today we will sit and eat tomorrow but who knows about tomorrow, we know that we cannot take money with us after death, still we run after money our whole life.</I></H6> </p>
<h4>We humans have fallen so low that we are selling the body created by God, not only this, we are killing others and selling them too. We rape and kill women and throw their bodies in the jungle or in small towns. They are cutting it into pieces and throwing it away, we humans are not at all fit for this life.</I></h6>
